A spinning cockroach demo for Nintendo DS

Have you ever seen a video [like this](https://youtu.be/FpouoDphV-I) and thought: "Man, this video is so uselessly amazing, I need to take it with me everywhere I go."\
Maybe not, but back in 2004-2006 you probably didn't have a portable device that you *could* put this video on. So why not have it in real time on the Nintendo DS?\
